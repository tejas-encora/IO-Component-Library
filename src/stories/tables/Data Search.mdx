# Data Table with Search

The IODataTableSearch component is used for displaying tabular data. Features include sorting, searching, pagination, grouping, and row selection.

This currently works properly in app, just not in Storybook. If used in app, it appears as:

<img src="dtable-tmp.png" alt="" />

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls />
