# Data Table

The IODataTable* components are used for displaying tabular data. Features include sorting, searching, pagination, grouping, and row selection.

Reference: [https://vuetifyjs.com/en/api/v-data-table/](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/api/v-data-table/)

**To use**:

```
npm install vite-plugins-vuetify
```
Make sure you have sass installed

```
npm install -D sass
```

In your 'vite.config.ts|js' file, add the following:

```
import vuetify from 'vite-plugin-vuetify'
```

```
plugins: [
    vue(),
    vuetify(),
]
  ```

In your 'main.js' add the following:
```
import 'vuetify/styles'
import { createVuetify } from 'vuetify'
import * as components from 'vuetify/components'
import * as directives from 'vuetify/directives'
import { aliases, fa } from 'vuetify/iconsets/fa'`

The theme property is currently being worked on. This is a sample for now.
const vuetify = createVuetify({
    components,
    directives,
    icons: {
        defaultSet: 'fa',
        aliases,
        sets: {
            fa
        },
    },
    theme: {
        defaultTheme: 'ioVuetifyTheme',
        themes: {
            ioVuetifyTheme: {
                dark: false,
                colors: {

                }
            }
        }
    }
})
createApp(App).use(vuetify).mount('#app')
```
You also need to add this to your vite.config.js. This is due to the fonts not currently loading in dist. IN PROGRESS

```
server: {
    fs: {
      // Allow serving files from one level up to the project root
      allow: ['..'],
    },
  },
  ```
